1/ fixed the crappy "del cannot del because foreign key" 
      (by doing them in reverse order, by adding a file)
2/ partially fixed a topic/topics bug
   2b/ and advocated for not adding arrays
3/ still got at least one schema problem preventing seeds (float?)
4/ we've got this bullshit seed sequence primary key problem
    fix it by moving our hardcoded seed ids to very large numbers.  be consistent.
